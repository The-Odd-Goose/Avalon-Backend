To run the container, we first need to build an image

If unfamiliar with docker, watch this first:

In order for this to work however, we need to have some things happen
First you need to set up your own firebase project and download the service-account key json into
a file called service-account.json

One of two ways can be done in order to build the image and execute this:
1. VS Code Docker Extension can help do this easily
Execute the following two commands
    - Docker Images: Build Image
    - Docker Images: Run

2. Execute the following two in the terminal
    - docker build -t <image-name>
    - docker run <image-tag>
