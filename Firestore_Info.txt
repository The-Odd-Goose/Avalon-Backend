Some important firestore rules:

Here is the youtube link: https://youtu.be/o7d5Zeic63s

Can only have ~1MB in a single document

Each time it queries it, indexes every field, including maps and its separate properties

And every time you query something in a map, gets everything from it

Also affects the security rules, you can't query a single part of the document, need to query it all

Queries are shallow, each time we query something, we don't get its sub-collections
This can be useful, but should not always be used -- group things that are displayed together into a single document and not subcollections

You're also billed by the number of reads and writes you perform

Queries find documents in a single collection
